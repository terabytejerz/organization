        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>"One person can make a difference as long as others will dare to care with them" </p><br>
        <p>
        	The Vigilantes Nocturnes have become integrated into the fabric of the city. Since 2017, the non-profit, Baguio City based group, has been responsible for protecting innocent citizens. Formed by Jefferson Cosme and 2 dedicated volunteers in Baguio City, the “Vigilantes Nocturnes” rode the subways to conduct  patrol to prevent crimes.  They understand that problems of any community cannot be solved single-handedly and requires the cooperation of all its members. They recognize the need to foster community pride and civic mindedness to help remove many of the societal ills making safety patrol necessary. This attitude runs throughout the multitude of community programs and services volunteers administer. The Vigilantes Nocturnes recognize that by thinking solely in terms of protection instead of prevention we are throwing up the white flag and surrendering to the inevitability of crime.
           </p>
        <br>
        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        <p>"Only by joining together and helping each other can live in safety and peace"</p>
        <p>
        	Safety Patrols have been the heart and soul of the Vigilantes Nocturnes since its inception. Patrol Volunteers are thoroughly trained in protection of self and others while regularly patrolling their communities. Their efforts help combat the terrifying disease of street crime by uniting citizens together to respond to the ever-changing elements of community problems. They address criminal activity where it is needed most and go beyond the defensive to empower the collective community by teaching practical skills, initiating community programs and emphasizing cooperation to solve problems.<br><br>The Vigilantes Nocturnes empower people by teaching practical skills and a full spectrum of “self-help” skills in schools, at their local chapter facilities and community centers. Their programs are enabling people to take action without relying on government, a key principle of The Vigilantes Nocturnes. Chapter Volunteers use their hard-earned experience to teach self-defense courses and “street smarts” skills to seniors, women and community groups, schools and university students around the country. From community defense classes, to training of life skills to adults and youth programs for at risk youth, the Vigilantes Nocturnes have the ability to see the big picture in how to respond to community issues from their very core. Fostering the self-reliance inherent in us all and understanding why local residents are most capable of solving their unique problems,Vigilantes Nocturnes are there to lend a helping hand as long as others are willing to Dare To Watch with them!
        </p><br>

        <h1>Why It Matters</h1>
        <p>"Do not believe for even one moment that things must always be the way they are now."</p>
        <p>The war we fight as Vigilantes Nocturnes trying to prevent crime is one we wage on multiple levels. And while we are honest in regards to the realities we face we also revel in every victory we can achieve. It motivates us and inspires us to carry on. We can not end crime all on our own, but with the support of the communities we serve, we are making a positive difference each and every day. Each potential crime we prevent improves life for all of us. Every mugging, robbery, rape, or murder we help stop is one more person and one more family that is spared the trauma that could have happened. Every time a senior is out for a walk and sees the Red Beret volunteers and feels a little safer we, the concerned citizens win a little victory. Each boy or girl that comes through our youth program doors is a another chance for a child to reach his or her own potential and for a neighborhood to keep another future contributor to society from falling victim to the streets.<br>
        We promise to continue to do our part, like we have for all these years. All we ask of you is simply that if you support our goals, if you agree with our efforts and if you can, then please contribute. Direct support from members of our community’s will allow us to maintain and increase our safety patrols making sure they are always properly equipped and trained to respond to the many situations they face on the streets. And while the safety patrols are out there doing their job your contribution will also allow us to serve the children through our youth outreach and mentoring programs. These programs may not get the press attention like the patrols however a firsthand look at them shows you what a direct and lasting impact they have. We have done much over the years with very little. We promise to put every gift we are fortunate enough to receive to good use and to make continue to make a difference.</p>
